This sample will provide the steps to create a simple PHP Web application that can consume SDWIS Data. 
The Envirofacts SDWIS database contains information about public water systems and their violations of EPA's drinking water regulations, as reported to EPA by the states. 
This API Data Sample will query and display active public water systems in the state of Rhode Island. 
Following these steps in order will allow the application to recreate the sample project.
