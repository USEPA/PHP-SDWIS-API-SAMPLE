This API data sample will provide the steps to create a simple PHP Web application that can consume Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) data from EPA's Envirofacts database. 

The Envirofacts SDWIS database contains information about public water systems and their violations of EPA's drinking water regulations, as reported to EPA by the states. 

This API data sample will query and display active public water systems in the state of Rhode Island. 
Project code and step-by-step guidance for this API sample can also be found here: http://developer.epa.gov/php-sample-code/
